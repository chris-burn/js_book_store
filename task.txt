Create a method that reports the financial situation of the Store. Balance and value of inventory.
Create a method that allows the store to view all Books of a given Genre.

Part C

Create a BookWorm (or Customer) constructor who can buy and sell Books.
The BookWorm should have cash that increase and decreases with buying and selling.
The BookWorm shouldn't be able to buy a Book if they can't afford it.
The BookWorm should be able to view the total value of their collection
The BookWorm should be able to view the total value of all books of a given Genre
The BookWorm should be able to view their longest book.
The BookWorm should be able to sort their books by value. (ascending or descending)

Extension

Model an AngryBookWorm that extends BookWorm
The AngryBookWorm should be able to burn controversial books
AngryBookWork should be able to deface a controversial book, ripping out a random number of pages
If AngryBookWorm tries to read a controversial book, they should return an appropriate String, and stop immediately. e.g. "Oh my days!"
